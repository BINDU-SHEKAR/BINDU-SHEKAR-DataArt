# MY 1st Timeline App 

This is the static skeleton of my first timeline app. It sets up the basic structure using semantic HTML elements, preparing the layout for future content and interactivity.

## Contents:

-> <header> that contains the logo and a theme toggle button.
-> <figure> element to group the logo image with its caption. I chose this tag because it semantically connects visual content with its description, making the header more accessible.
-> <nav> section reserved for future filters or category selectors. Even though it's empty now, it helps define the navigation area early on.
-><main> tag to wrap the core content of the app, emphasizing its importance for screen readers and accessibility tools.
-> <section id="timeline"> where timeline events will eventually be displayed. I used `<section>` to indicate that this part will contain related content grouped by purpose.
-> <div id="modal"> for future pop-ups or event details. I kept it hidden for now, but it's ready to be styled and activated later.

This index.html file does not include any styling or dynamic behavior. 
It focuses only on layout and semantic structure.
 I added comments in the HTML to mark where future features will go, 
and I plan to build on this foundation in the next stages.
