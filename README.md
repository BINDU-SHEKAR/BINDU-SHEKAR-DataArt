# My 1st Timeline App(with css)

This is a simple timeline web page showing some milestones in my learning journey. 
I built it using HTML and CSS(as of my knowledge i have gained till now).

# Files

- 'second.html': Contains the structure of the page using semantic tags.
- 'myapp.css': Adds styling and makes the layout responsive.
- 'README.md': Notes about the project.

# What all I did in Task 2

- Used Flexbox to make the timeline layout responsive.
- Styled the header with a color and added a title.
- Added basic styles for the timeline events and a modal (hidden by default).
- Used media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

## Notes

I tried to keep the project code simple and easy to understand.
I added comments in the CSS to explain what each part does.
