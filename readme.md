# Task 4 - Timeline App with TypeScript

This task improves the timeline project by using TypeScript for better structure and safety.

# Features
- Loads event data from 'events.json' using 'fetch()'.
- Displays events dynamically on the timeline.
- Uses TypeScript with strict typing and modular code.
- Compiled TypeScript runs in the browser as JavaScript.

# How to Run
1. Keep all files ('index.html', 'four.css', 'events.json', 'dist/index.js') in the same folder.
2. Compile TypeScript using `tsc` to generate 'dist/index.js'.
3. Run the project using `live-server` or any local server.
4. Events will appear on the timeline.

# Notes
- Images are placeholders and can be replaced with actual image links.
- TypeScript source code is in the 'src' folder.
- Works in modern browsers.
